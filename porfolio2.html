                            "From the students for the students"
                        </h1>

                        <h2>Intro</h2>
                        <p>
                            From May 2019 to May 2021 I was part of the Students Faculty Council
                            at the Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics, Sofia University. As a
                            member, I wanted to do something for the council that would be useful
                            and used by the members of the next generations.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Overall goal</h2>
                        <p>
                            The council had a Worpress website that design and structure weren't
                            updated since 2014. So I decided I will take the initiative to update
                            it. I wanted my university colleges to find important information more
                            easily, answers to their questions, and to have a place where the role
                            and activity of the students' council will be recorded.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Problem statement</h2>
                        <p>
                            One of the problems with the old design is that it wasn't very
                            responsive. And since 2014 the use of smartphones to search for
                            information and do daily work has risen. So our focus was for the site
                            to be mobile-first. Also, there was a lot of outdated information that
                            had to be updated.
                        </p>
                        <label>Screenshots from the old website.</label>

                        <h2>Team</h2>
                        <p>To be the work done we formed a workgroup of 5 people:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Petko Petkov - he had the most experience in the activities of the
                                council and helped with the new structure of the website, and
                                updated old information on the site
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Rosina Georgieva - at the time she was the chairman of the
                                council's PR commission, so she was responsible for the content
                                (text descriptions ) of the website, and updated old information on
                                the site
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Nikola Totev - helped with the new structure of the website, and
                                updated old information on the site
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Todor Dimitrov - helped with the new structure of the website, and
                                updated old information on the site
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            My main role was to organize, coordinate, track if work has done, and
                            make changes to the website. As a whole, we had meetings and worked
                            together to update the website.
                        </p>

                        <h1>Process</h1>
                        <p>
                            First, we started with the structure of the old website. I had created
                            a sitemap of it.
                        </p>
                        <img class="article-images" src="../assets/img/portfolio/article-images/old_structure.png" />
                        <a href="../assets/img/portfolio/article-images/old_structure.png" data-gallery="portfolioGallery" class="portfolio-lightbox zoom" title="FSS"><i class="bi bi-zoom-in"></i>Zoom in</a>
                        <p>
                            And after we discuss what changes we will do and who will take what
                            section to edit I have created a new sitemap.
                        </p>
                        <img class="article-images" src="../assets/img/portfolio/article-images/new_structure_v.1.png" />
                        <a href="../assets/img/portfolio/article-images/new_structure_v.1.png" data-gallery="portfolioGallery" class="portfolio-lightbox zoom" title="FSS"><i class="bi bi-zoom-in"></i>Zoom in</a>
                        <p>
                            The next step I did was to create a mockup of our main(home) page
                            based on the statistics of the most visited pages of the site and what
                            the council want's
                        </p>
                        <img class="article-images" src="../assets/img/portfolio/article-images/mockup1.png" />
                        <a href="../assets/img/portfolio/article-images/mockup1.png" data-gallery="portfolioGallery" class="portfolio-lightbox zoom" title="FSS"><i class="bi bi-zoom-in"></i>Zoom in</a>
                        <img class="article-images" src="../assets/img/portfolio/article-images/mockup2.png" />
                        <a href="../assets/img/portfolio/article-images/mockup2.png" data-gallery="portfolioGallery" class="portfolio-lightbox zoom" title="FSS"><i class="bi bi-zoom-in"></i>Zoom in</a>
                        <img class="article-images" src="../assets/img/portfolio/article-images/mockup3.png" />
                        <a href="../assets/img/portfolio/article-images/mockup3.png" data-gallery="portfolioGallery" class="portfolio-lightbox zoom" title="FSS"><i class="bi bi-zoom-in"></i>Zoom in</a>
                        <p>In the mockup there are 6 sections:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Upcoming Events - The idea of the first section was to show the
                                upcoming events in a slider and to redirect users to more
                                information about them.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Shortcuts - The main usage of the second section was to be a
                                shortcut to the most important parts of the site - University
                                materials, Frequently Asked Questions, and Information for candidate
                                students. In this way, they will spend less time searching for this
                                information on the site.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                About Us - The third section had the role to tell about the council
                                in few sentences who we are and to redirect users to information
                                about us.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                News - Here we are going to be displaying news about our events,
                                university information, and more.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Useful links - The idea of this section is to have useful university
                                links in one place, so students more easily can find their needed
                                information from other websites.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Contacts - In this mockup, we have a contact section, because is
                                less in less engaging for the users to scroll down than searching a
                                button in the navigation bar.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>But after discussion we decided to change:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Section 1 - because we use social media for promoting events and our
                                audience learns about them from there.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Section 3 - we decided to remove this section and to put it in the
                                first place. Because we want when our audience visits our site to
                                learn more about who we are, what we do, and how they can join.
                            </li>
                            <li>Section 5 - we put this section under the contacts section.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Also to add a Contact us page also for more additional information.
                            The next step was to find a WordPress Theme that will be responsive
                            and will be ideal for our ideas.
                        </p>
                        <img class="article-images" src="../assets/img/portfolio/article-images/temp.png" />
                        <a href="../assets/img/portfolio/article-images/temp.png" data-gallery="portfolioGallery" class="portfolio-lightbox zoom" title="FSS"><i class="bi bi-zoom-in"></i>Zoom in</a>
                        <p>We have tried few themes but finally decided to use Hestia, because the layout and
                            customization met our needs. </p>
                        <h1>Final look</h1>
                        <p>After 2 months of work, our new site was ready.
                             The final result you can see here <a class="zoom" href="https://fss.fmi.uni-sofia.bg/">https://fss.fmi.uni-sofia.bg/</a>
